    //   vector), we can normalize it (probably SHOULD, but hey ho we'll figure it out).

    // Let's say angle was initially 45, and the vehicle moves down
    // The angle becomes 40, this means the delta is -5. This means we have to turn the
    // wheels to the left because we're moving on a negative angle.
    // By how much? I think it's easier to start with an angle of 0, car is right above
    // Interesting, I don't think this holds at 45 angle but let's go through some examples;
    //
    // Angle 0, and I move down at 180, distance increases, angle stays the same (unlikely) this
    // means turn left or right
    //
    // Angle 0 and I go right (at 90), now, the new angle is something like -5, wheels need to turn
    // left, I turn the wheel left something like MAX_WHEEL_TURN * (5 / 180) and move forward some
    // time. The minus was transformed in the "right or left" axis for the wheels
    //
    // Angle 0, I go left at -90, angle is something like 5, wheels need to turn right, same
    // calculation as above
    //
    // The problem with this example above is that the weels need to turn right quite a lot, not
    // just by 5 degrees. For example if I go 90 degrees in the wrong direction, I should correct
    // and go 90 degrees in the right direction. So I think the angle difference here should be
    // before and after my car position and before and after car target position. So, 90 degrees in
    // the wrong direction
    // TO THE EXAMPLES:
    // - Angle 0 (prec, pret)
    // - TAngle 5 (c,t) => means my car basically went left
    // - CAngle 90 (prec, c) => how bad my car went left, it could go left cause I did 90, but it
    // can also go left cause I did 135 or 180 degrees!
    // - So here we have the calculation CAngle / 180 * TAngleSign?
    //
    // Looks pretty straight forward so far. What can break?
    // - Stuck in a wall => no motion => go back X seconds, add more 'accent' to the turn (turn
    // left / right harder)
